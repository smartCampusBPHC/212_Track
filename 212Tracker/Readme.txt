1. On the IMB Bluemix page, we clicked 'Getting Started' right above the overview("https://console.ng.bluemix.net/apps/325e765c-5cef-4508-88d8-469966ca83b5?paneId=startcoding&ace_config=%7B%22orgGuid%22%3A%2293a835e9-2d81-4219-bfa0-127a05a761fc%22%2C%22spaceGuid%22%3A%227f5b3ab0-7f7d-42ac-be80-cc7f7e5a2ccf%22%2C%22redirect%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.ng.bluemix.net%2Fdashboard%2Fapplications%22%2C%22bluemixUIVersion%22%3A%22Atlas%22%7D&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south").

2. We downloaded the cloudfoundry and bluemix command line interfaces. Bluemix was not Working in our case. So, we used cloud foundry.Just replace Bluemix in the command line with cf(for cloud foundry).

3. We downloaded the starter code from "https://console.ng.bluemix.net/rest/apps/325e765c-5cef-4508-88d8-469966ca83b5/starter-download".

4. We downloaded all the files from the git repository "212Track".

5. We copied all the files from the 212Track repository into server folder in the starter code folder(212Tracker\server).

6. We followed the remaining instructions on the Getting Started Page(login and push).
