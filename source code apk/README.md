# GPS_Tracker
A Project that tracks the GPS location of a device and constantly upadtes a server in 10 mins. 
It optimizes power by stopping location tracking when internet is off. 
It also works on Android M , by getting location permission. 

Right now it has no UI. Just a sample project to track Location.
